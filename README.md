# Taxi Tab
## About
Taxi Tab is the final project for Interface Design II.
The purpose is to create a responsive iPad app using `@media only screen` queries.

##Calculate Screen
Takes the number of miles, multiplying it by $3/mile. Plus the base sittingFee. Then it divides the total number of people in your party to get what each person should pay.

Also as a side project, I'm figuring out just how the heck GitHub works.
